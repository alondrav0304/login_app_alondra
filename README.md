# 🐻 Animated Login App with Rive

## Description
This is a Flutter mobile app featuring a **custom animated login screen**. The app uses **Rive animations** to make user interactions more fun and engaging. When typing in the email or password fields, the character reacts by moving its eyes or covering them with hands. Successful login triggers a happy animation, while invalid credentials trigger a sad animation.

## Rive & State Machine
[Rive](https://rive.app/) is a tool to create interactive animations for apps. A **State Machine** in Rive allows you to control animations programmatically based on user interactions or app states, making the character respond dynamically to input.
